  * The motivation was to create something that would help end the spread of misinformation regarding cannabis, encourage people to learn more about this plant to understand why its use has spanned thousand of years, also give the user a place to share their own reviews on strains of cannabis they have experience with and allows them to give a rating. With this type of platform it could be achieved that a more informed public will have a more robust understanding of cannabis.
